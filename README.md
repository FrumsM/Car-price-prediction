# Car-price-prediction

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting car prices based on the available data. For this task, we will utilize CatBoost, a powerful gradient boosting library specifically designed to handle categorical features.

In the scope of this project, we plan to undertake the following steps:

1. Data Preparation: With a dataset containing car information, we will perform data preprocessing. This step involves handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and other necessary data transformations.

2. Model Creation and Training: We will select CatBoost as our primary tool for forecasting car prices. Using the CatBoost library, we will create and train a model on the prepared data. Hyperparameters of the model will be tuned to achieve the best performance.

3. Model Evaluation: After training the model, we will evaluate its performance using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) metric.

4. Predicting Car Prices on New Data: Upon completing the training and evaluation stages, we will apply the model to new dataset to predict car prices. 

5. Documentation and Presentation of Results: At the end of the project, we will create a report or notebook describing the process, data preprocessing, model configuration, performance evaluation, and car price predictions. This documentation will provide a comprehensive overview of the project and its outcomes.

By leveraging CatBoost's capabilities, we aim to develop a reliable and accurate model for forecasting car prices, which can be valuable for various applications in the automotive industry.
